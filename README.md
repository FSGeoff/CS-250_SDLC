## How to interpret user needs and implement them into a program

1. **Gather Requirements**: Start by talking to the user or the customer to understand their needs, expectations, and requirements. 
2. **Create User Stories**: These stories should be written from the user's perspective, and they should be easy to understand. 
3. **Break User Sories into Smaller Tasks**: These tasks should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
4. **Develop a Plan**: Develop a plan: Create a development plan that outlines the tasks that need to be completed, the resources required, and the timeline for completion. 
5. **Implement The Program**: Use the development plan to implement the program. 
6. **Test and Validate**: Test the program thoroughly to ensure that it meets the user's requirements and that it is bug-free.
7. **Iterate and Improve**: Use feedback from the user to improve the program.

## How to approach developing programs

Developing programs involves a systematic approach that requires careful planning, design, implementation, and testing. It's also imortant to use a structured and methodical approach that ensures that the program is designed, implemented, and tested to meet the user's requirements. I look forward to using many of the different Agile proccesses in my future; such as SaFE, LeSS, and Scrum@Agile.
